# Three-body-fits
We want to analyze data from three-body $B$-decay experiments.
This code takes data from experimental three-body Dalitz analyses and generates observables after fully symmetrizing the three-body amplitude over the three final-state four-momenta.

## Getting Started
Download the code from github by either performing a git pull or simply clicking on "download zip" on the upper right-hand corner.

### Prerequisites
In order to run this code you will need Mathematica (version 7.0 or higher) on your machine. The recommended version of Mathematica is the newest version or at least version 9.0 of higher. The code itself has all reference BABAR papers from which the data was taken.
